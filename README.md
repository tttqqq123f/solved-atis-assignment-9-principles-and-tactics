We apply principles and tactics to the architecture of our system. We choose the two most important architectural principles, which will guide architectural decision making. We also decide for specific tactics that help us to achieve the desired system qualities.

<ul>

 <li>Which 2 architectural principles are the most important ones in your opinion when developing the system architecture? Why did you decide for these principles? How do the two selected principles help in achieving the 2 desired system qualities that you selected in Assignment 6?</li>

 <li>Based on the diagram of slide deck A9, which shows architectural principles support each other, create a variant of this diagram for the 2 principles that you selected. Show in this diagram how other principles can support these two principles. Annotate the relationship arrows in your variant of the diagram with specific ideas/solutions that you will apply when implementing the principles in the architecture.</li>

 <li>Select 1 tactic for each of the 2 quality attributes that you selected in Assignment 6. Select the tactics from the collection of tactics in the book by Bass, Clements, and Kazman. For each tactic, discuss briefly how it would be implemented in the system and describe how the tactic supports the quality attribute.</li>
